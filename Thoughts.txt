need:
- function that runs on all exit paths of the subsystem
    - that also has access to the locked parent, to remove itself from the list of children
- is list of children really important?
    - atomic counter could work
    - but what about error propagation?

- error propagation maybe not necessary.
    - register closure that will be executed on error/shutdown of the child
    - every subsystem can have 'shutdown triggers' attached to it

fixed facts:
- subsystems will never change their parent
